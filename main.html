	<p>We can optimize a solution using both time and space optimization. To optimize a program,</p>

	<ol>1. We can reduce the time taken to run the program and increase the space occupied</ol>
	<ol>2. We can reduce the memory usage of the program and increase itâ€™s total run time</ol>
	<ol>3. We can reduce both time and space complexity by deploying relevant algorithms</ol>
